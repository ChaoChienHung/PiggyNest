# 📌 TODO

- [ ] Compare the config.yaml vs config.py and possibly move the configuration to Config.yaml
- [ ] Use REST API to move the logic to API endpoint to allow for calling
- [ ] Use FAST API to host the asynchronous non blocking server
- [ ] Use Streamlit to provide a simple web and API test
- [ ] Add currency category in the data
- [ ] Add a user login form for login feature
- [ ] Change multiple accounts into "piggy bank" which allows for name editing and integrate them into a single user to allow for more useful operation
- [ ] Update the transfer feature so that it has the option to directly transfer to the known account and transfer to unknown account. When it is used to transfer between piggy banks, it shouldn't be accounted in the expenditure.
- [ ] Update the total cost feature so that it can automatically aggregate the cost across all piggy banks.
- [ ] Combine the entire dataset into a altogether data that only stores each month's total cost and cost percentage, to reduce the memory and dataset stored.
- [ ] Seek for other option except csv, which is not practical in real-world scenario.
